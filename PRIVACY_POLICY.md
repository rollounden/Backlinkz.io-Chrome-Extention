# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the SEO Checker Chrome Extension ("we," "our," or "the extension") handles information when you use our Chrome browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

The SEO Checker Chrome Extension operates entirely locally on your device. All analysis and processing occurs within your browser without sending any information to external servers or third parties.

## What We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit:

- ❌ **Personally Identifiable Information** - No names, addresses, email addresses, or identification numbers
- ❌ **Health Information** - No health or medical data
- ❌ **Financial Information** - No payment or credit card information
- ❌ **Authentication Information** - No passwords or credentials
- ❌ **Personal Communications** - No emails, texts, or messages
- ❌ **Location Data** - No GPS coordinates, IP addresses, or location information
- ❌ **Web History** - No browsing history or visited page records
- ❌ **User Activity** - No clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, or keystrokes
- ❌ **Website Content** - No text, images, or data from websites you visit

## How the Extension Works

The extension only accesses the currently active browser tab when you click the extension icon. It:

1. **Analyzes the current webpage** - Reads HTML, meta tags, headings, links, and images from the active tab
2. **Processes data locally** - All analysis happens in your browser using JavaScript
3. **Displays results** - Shows SEO metrics in the extension popup interface
4. **Provides visual overlays** - Optionally highlights elements on the page (headings, links, images) when you activate visualization features

**All processing occurs locally on your device. No data leaves your computer.**

## Permissions Used

The extension requires minimal permissions:

- **activeTab** - Allows the extension to access the content of the currently active tab only when you click the extension icon
- **scripting** - Enables the extension to inject content scripts to analyze page elements and provide visual overlays

These permissions are the minimum required to provide the extension's functionality. The extension does not have background access and only runs when you actively use it.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties** because we do not collect any data in the first place.

## External Links

The extension may provide links to external services (such as Ahrefs, Google Rich Results Test) for additional analysis. When you click these links, you will be directed to those third-party websites, which have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external websites.

## Cookies and Tracking

The extension does not use cookies, tracking pixels, analytics tools, or any other tracking mechanisms.

## Data Storage

The extension does not store any data locally or remotely. All analysis results are displayed temporarily in the extension popup and are not saved.

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any data, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over your privacy when using this extension.
